                    <strong>First Episode: </strong>I can remember when I was in the school, I had issue with one of my
                    subject (Calculus) it was very difficult for me because the lecturer was not helpful. After I took
                    the exam and the result came out very poor, I felt disappointed and that gave me a lot of concern
                    because I don’t want to have an extra year in the university due to this particular course. I
                    decided to look for a solution by meeting a friend of my which I believed has a better understanding
                    of this subject. Luckily, she was very happy to offer me a help and took her time to break down the
                    subject to me, she also introduced me on tutorial class on this particular subject and some online
                    materials. Finally, when I took the second exam (carry-over) the result came out fine, at that
                    moment I was really excited. So after I graduated from the University I decided to advance more to
                    improve my knowledge on Maths related subjects that is one of the reasons I did (PGD) Petroleum and
                    Gas Engineering. Afterwards my confidence in Maths has greatly 
                    improved.

                    <strong>Second Episode: </strong>During my final year project in the university, I faced financial
                    challenge to carry out my research project. My project work required me to travel and collect
                    samples for laboratory analysis and I don’t have money to complete it. So I decided to do some minor
                    jobs to raise money and complete my research work. Luckily, with the support of my friend and the
                    amount I was able to raised within that period, my project work was completed successfully.

                    <strong>Third Episode: </strong>The most difficult issue I faced is after I graduated from the
                    University. I searched for a job but was unable to secure one. I felt very bad that moment so I
                    decided do some unskilled work and I was able to realised some money and, I used the money to opened
                    up a business centre (Printing and Photocopying) that was what I was doing till I got a job.
